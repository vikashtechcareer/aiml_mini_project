# AI & MLops Mini Project

Implement API endpoints for  A/B testing and canary deployment for different versions of an ML model.These api endpoint will help in serving predictions . As part of this implementations we will compare performance of two (or more) models and deploy them incrementally to simulate a real-world rollout.


**ML Models**: RandomForest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN, Decision Tree

**Datasets**: Iris, Titanic

**API Framework**: Flask

**Deployment Concept**: A/B Testing and Canary Deployment

**Evaluation**: Generate a comparison report with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
